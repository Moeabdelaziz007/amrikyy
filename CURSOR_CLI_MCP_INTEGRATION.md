## Implementation Details

### MCP Server Integration
The Cursor CLI tool is integrated into the AuraOS MCP server (`server/mcp-server.ts`) with the following features:

- **Tool Registration**: Properly registered in the MCP server tool registry
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input schema validation
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with detailed error messages
- **Response Formatting**: Structured responses with execution metadata

### MCP Protocol Integration
The tool is also integrated into the MCP protocol (`server/mcp-protocol.ts`) with:

- **Core Tool Definition**: Defined as a core MCP tool
- **Execution Method**: Dedicated execution method with realistic responses
- **Response Templates**: Pre-defined response templates for each operation type

## Testing

### Test Script
A comprehensive test script (`test-cursor-cli-mcp.cjs`) is provided that:

- Tests all 7 operation types
- Simulates realistic execution times
- Provides usage examples
- Demonstrates integration capabilities

### Running Tests
```bash
# Test Cursor CLI MCP tool
npm run test:cursor-cli

# Test all MCP tools
npm run test:mcp-tools

# Start MCP server
npm run mcp-server
```

## Response Format

### Success Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "model": "claude-3.5-sonnet",
  "operation_type": "explain",
  "command": "explain this React component",
  "context": "This component handles user profile display",
  "file_path": "src/components/UserCard.tsx",
  "output": "**Code Explanation:**\n\n...detailed explanation...",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "execution_time_ms": 1250,
  "suggestions": [
    "Consider implementing the suggested improvements",
    "Run tests to verify functionality",
    "Review the generated code for your specific use case",
    "Add proper error handling if not already present"
  ]
}
```

### Error Response
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Error message description",
  "command": "explain this React component",
  "model": "claude-3.5-sonnet",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```
